# website-python-development


This project started from Jay's [Creating a Web App From Scratch Using Python Flask and MySQL](https://code.tutsplus.com/series/creating-a-web-app-from-scratch-using-python-flask-and-mysql--cms-827) tutorial and has now grown into its own derivative.
I plan to add other features and test scenarios to this project  to gain a better understanding of Python, Web Design, MySQL, and whatever else comes to mind.

The bare bones of this project have been implemented! The app now supports the ability for a User to Sign Up, Login/Authenticate, and Add Wishes to their Bucket List. There's even a
public dashboard that functions like allows for all collective Users to share public wishes like a real community!

What a great milestone ðŸ˜Š

I wonder where this project will go from here?
